#1.1 An investment has probabilities 0.1, 0.2, 0.35, 0.25, and 0.1 of giving returns equal to 40%, 30%, 15%, −5%, and
#−15%. What are the expected returns and the standard deviations of returns?

probabilities = [0.1, 0.2, 0.35, 0.25, 0.1]
returns = [40, 30, 15, -5, -15]

#convert from percentages to decimal
returns = [i/100 for i in returns]

#First we calculate expected returns, then we calculated the squared deviations.
expectedreturns=sum([i*j for i, j in zip(probabilities, returns)])
squareddeviations=[abs(i-expectedreturns)**2 for i in returns]
sd=math.sqrt(sum([i*j for i, j in zip(probabilities, squareddeviations)]))

#Attempting to do the above in two lines.
#sd=math.sqrt(sum([i*abs(j-expectedreturns)**2 for i, j in zip(probabilities, returns)]))

#Attempting in one line (This is very bad code).
#sd=math.sqrt(sum([i*abs(j-sum([i*j for i, j in zip(probabilities, returns)]))**2 for i, j in zip(probabilities,
# returns)]))


#To output the float with 3 significant figures, use .3f to format the number.
print(f"{expectedreturns:.3f} {sd:.4f}")

#From this it seems the use of zip and arrays of probabilities and returns is useful.
